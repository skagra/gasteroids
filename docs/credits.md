# Credits

The following lists all external resources (fonts, graphics and sound) used in the game.

## Audio

* Game audio effects were downloaded from the [Classic Gaming](https://classicgaming.cc/classics/asteroids/sounds) site.
* The splash screen [sound](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/tension-booster-03-253279/) is by [Peter Barbaix](https://pixabay.com/users/thefealdoproject-4574887/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=music&utm_content=253279) from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=music&utm_content=253279)

## Sprites

* Sprite images were downloaded from [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/content/asteroids-vector-style-sprites) and were created by by Joe Strout.  I've modified these a little to address a problem in cutting out each of the sprites without compromising the glow effect.

## Fonts

* The [Astrospace](https://www.fontspace.com/a-astro-space-font-f46028) font by [wepfont](https://wepfont.com/) is used for the *modern* UI theme.
* The [Hyperspace](https://www.dafont.com/hyperspace.font) font by [Pixel Sagas](http://www.pixelsagas.com/) is used for the *classic* UI theme.

## Background

* The background image was downloaded from [HDQwalls](https://hdqwalls.com/wallpaper/1920x1080/outer-digital-space) where it is uncredited.
