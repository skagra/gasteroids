# How to Play

Game play is as per the classic arcade game.  

You control a ship which is surrounded by a field of asteroids.  Your ship may be rotated and accelerated forwards by applying thrust.  It is equipped with a blaster which is used to destroy asteroids.

There are three sizes of asteroids. *Large* asteroids split into two *medium* asteroids when hit, in turn these split into two *small* asteroids which themselves explode into dust when hit.

Periodically an enemy saucer will appear and attempt to destroy your ship.  There are two types of saucer, the larger slow moving variety which shoots randomly and the smaller swifter variety which directly targets your ship.

As a last resort you may make a hyperspace jump.  This is fraught with danger, your ship could spontaneously explode or you might rematerialize inside an asteroid.

Sometimes destroying an asteroid causes a *Power Up* to spawn, pilot your ship over the *Power Up* to collect it.

Of course your ship is destroyed should you collide with an asteroid or a saucer or be hit by a saucer's missile.

Once all asteroids have been destroyed a new, more difficult, asteroid field spawns.
